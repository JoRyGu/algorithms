SHORT ANSWER
1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?
  - You're waiting to pick up someone named Dave at the airport. You don't know Dave
    by sight, so you have to ask the departing passengers their name, one by one, until
    you find Dave.

2. What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?
  - Browsing for books in a libarary. You might start at a more arbitrary point than
    the exact middle, but the principle is the same. Is the title of the book after
    M or before M in alphabetical order. If it's before M go to the left, etc, etc.

3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations 
   would it take to find the value G using linear search?
   - 7, one for each element of the list.

4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations
   would it take to find the value of G using binary search?
   - 3 if you implemented binary search as shown in the example. 1 if you implemented
     a check against the start and end index before starting the loop.

5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between
   linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
    - I would choose linear search. Binary search only works on sorted lists. In order to implement
      binary search I would have to sort the collection which would mean iterating through the list
      at least once in the absolute best case. Linear search at the worst case would loop through the
      entire list one time.

6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between
   linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
   - I would choose binary search. Because the collection is sorted, binary search is able to complete
     in O (log n) time, which is much faster than the O (n) time that linear search would take.

PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT

1. You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary
   the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

   function dictionarySearch(word, dictionary) {
    let start = 0;
    let end = dictionary.length - 1;
    let mid = Math.floor(dictionary.length / 2);

    while(start < end) {
      if (word === dictionary[mid]) {
        return mid;
      } else if (word === dictionary[start]) {
        return start;
      } else if (word === dictionary[end]) {
        return end;
      }

      if (word < dictionary[mid]) {
        end = mid;
        mid = Math.floor((end + start) / 2);
        end--;
      } else {
        start = mid;
        mid = Math.floor((end + start) / 2);
        start++;
      }
    }

    return -1;
  }

2. You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the 
   fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

   function goldfishFinder(fishType, fishTank) {
    for(let i = 0; i < fishTank.length; i++) {
      if(fishTank[i] === fishType) {
        return i;
      }
    }

    return -1;
  }
